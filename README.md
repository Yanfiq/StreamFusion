### Screenshots
Still rewriting to jetpack compose

## Who?
No one, I just woke up and suddenly my IDE magically contained the code by itself, even though I had dreamed of writing the code

## When?
After World War II

## Where?
On the earth.

## Why?
This project is my attempt to learn Android development, such as the following materials:
1. Activity and Intent
2. Layout (XML and Jetpack Compose)
3. Connection to web API (Retrofit)
4. File storage (Data Store)
5. ViewModel & LiveData
6. Asynchronous Programming (Coroutines)
etc. i think...

## How?
Clone this repo, and help me work on it, sorry if the code sucks
